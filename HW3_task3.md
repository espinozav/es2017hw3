The following repo was cloned from this Github https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/guns-data

The script that was analyzed in this repo is CDC_parser.R 
The purpose of this code is the following:
   1. download dataset for various years from URL
   2. parse the dataset from CDC Crime datasets by year
   3. Create 3 clean, organized (i.e. column names added, files by year)
       a. suicide_13.Rdata 
       b. gun_deaths_13.Rdata
       c. all_deaths_13.Rdata 
  
I did not provide a snippet of the R script in this notebook since it was hanging when creating the html file.
